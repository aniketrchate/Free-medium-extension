# Free-Medium

## This extension Unlocks medium.com for free unlimited reads, no membership is required

#### I know, this hack is very useful. But there are limitations. 
- You won't be signed in when using this extension.
- You cannot clap, comment, highlight or do anything else that a Member can do.

Hence, my suggestion even creating this extension is to become a paid member by giving $5 per month because the authors of these articles get a portion from members' monthly subscription fees.

------------


#### **Install the extension**
- Download the zip file and extract it at the location you want.
- Open the **Extensions** page, for Google Chrome enter *chrome://extensions/* this location in the browser and enable **Developer mode**.
- Click on the **Load unpacked** button and select the extracted directory.
